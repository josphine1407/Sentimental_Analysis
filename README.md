# Sentimental Analysis   

A **Flask-powered web application** that performs **sentiment analysis** on user-input text.  
The app uses **Machine Learning (scikit-learn)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLTK)** to classify text as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.

## How It Works  

The application workflow is divided into the following steps:  

### 1. Input  
- User submits a comment or text through the web form.  

### 2. Preprocessing  
- Convert text to lowercase and remove unwanted characters  
- Remove stopwords (using **NLTK**)  
- Apply stemming (**PorterStemmer**)  

### 3. Vectorization  
- Convert cleaned text into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorizer** (`tfidf.pkl`)  

### 4. Prediction  
- Pre-trained classifier (`clf.pkl`) predicts the sentiment label (Positive / Negative / Neutral)  

### 5. Output  
- Predicted sentiment is displayed back on the webpage in real time  


## Model Training (Notebook)  

The Jupyter Notebook covers the following stages:  

### 1. Data Preparation  
- Load dataset  
- Explore text samples and labels  

###  2. Preprocessing  
- Tokenization & stopword removal  
- Stemming / normalization  

### 3. Feature Engineering  
- Convert text into vectors using **TF-IDF**  

### 4. Model Training  
- Train models such as **Logistic Regression** or **Naive Bayes**  

### 5. Evaluation  
- Measure **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**  

### 6. Saving Artifacts  
- Save trained model → `clf.pkl`  
- Save TF-IDF vectorizer → `tfidf.pkl`  

## Example Output  
### Input:  
"I really love this product, it's amazing!"

### Output:  
✅ Sentiment: Positive
